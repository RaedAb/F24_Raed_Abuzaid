This is a basic platformer level. The goal is to collect all of the small stars and the big end star appears
You will likely run into a situation where you can hand on blocks or ground.
This was initially a bug but I tought it was cool and left is as a feature.
To reach the stars under a block you will hang from under.
HINT: when you are hanging hold a direction and up arrow and see what happens
Ultimatly collect the stars and reach the big star to win
